# Adventure To Taika

## Project Summary
Adventure To Taika is a single-player, text-based adventure game developed in Python[cite: 1]. It aims to capture the spirit of 1980s interactive fiction, where players navigate a mysterious realm and solve puzzles using text commands[cite: 2].

## Features
* **Compelling Narrative:** Engage in a storyline filled with mystery[cite: 3, 11].
* **Challenging Puzzles:** Solve logical and challenging puzzles integrated into the game world[cite: 3, 9, 13].
* **Inventory System:** Manage items with a robust inventory and interaction system[cite: 3, 8].
* **Custom Python Engine:** Powered by a custom engine for parsing commands and managing game state[cite: 3, 8].
* **Text-Based Interaction:** Uses a command parser designed for simple natural language input[cite: 13].
* **Immersive World:** Explores a world brought to life through descriptive text[cite: 11].

## Project Goals
1.  Develop a functional text-based adventure game in Python[cite: 8].
2.  Create an immersive narrative experience with a compelling storyline[cite: 10, 11].
3.  Capture the feel of classic 80's text adventures through gameplay and puzzle design[cite: 12, 13].

## Project Team
* **Hannah Rose:** Game Design (Narrative, Puzzles, World) & Content Creation[cite: 4, 5].
* **Linus Walker:** Programming (Game Engine, Logic) & Version Control[cite: 4, 6, 7].
* Both team members are involved in Testing and Debugging[cite: 5, 6].
